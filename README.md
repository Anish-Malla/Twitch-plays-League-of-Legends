# Twitch-plays-League-of-Legends
Using this python script twitch chat can control all of your abilities and summoner spells in League of Legends. You could add more functions such as movement control but I made it simple with the chat only being able to control keyboard presses (q, w, e, r, d, f). There will be a small unavoidable lag but overall it works well.
